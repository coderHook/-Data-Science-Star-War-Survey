# -Data-Science-Star-War-Survey
DS project to practice cleaning and mungling data under the star wars series topic.

In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook and analyzing data on the Star Wars movies. When you're finished, you'll have a notebook you can either add to your portfolio, or expand on your own.

Google, StackOverflow, and the documentation for various packages will help you as you progress through this project. All data scientists make extensive use of resources like these as they write code.

We'd love to hear your feedback as you go through this project. We hope it's a great experience!
